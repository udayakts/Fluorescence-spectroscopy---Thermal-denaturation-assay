# Fluorescence spectroscopy: Thermal denaturation of membrane protein
Tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra were analyzed to determine melting temperature, which is a thermal stability indicator.
- Fluorescence signals were corrected for temperature-dependence
- The  initial and final state fluorescence signals were determined
- The unfolded fraction was calculated
- Plotted against absolute temperature and fitted using a nonlinear fitted
